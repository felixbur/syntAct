# SSML code

This containes code to simulate emotional arousal with SSML tags.

A paper with evaluation is 

*Going Retro: Astonishingly Simple Yet Effective Rule-based Prosody Modelling for Speech Synthesis Simulating Emotion Dimensions*

The code is a running flask http application and can be found [here](http_interface/audio_services/)


Here are some demo audio files 

| arousal/valence | 0.0 | 0.5 | 1.0 |
